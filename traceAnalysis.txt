"dotStridevsCont.trace" Analysis Notes:

Observations:
- Stride version of dot product has more GPU actions in its "Fragment Shaders" section
    - Actions: Read and Write data

Analysis:
- This is expected, since when a stride data access pattern is used instead of continuous access, cache coherency will be lower. Each access will require a new data action.
